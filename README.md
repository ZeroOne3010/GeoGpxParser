This program is great especially for analyzing your My Finds Pocket Query files.
You can also use it to analyze other Pocket Queries in order to learn about the
caches in the given area.

Technically this program is used to parse a .gpx file, which is an XML file, of 
geocaches into plain old Java objects (POJO). The caches are then saved as a tab
delimited text file, one cache per row. In this format it is easy to load the
caches into a spreadsheet program for further inspection. 

In addition to saving the caches as a text file, another text file is also 
saved: one with statistics about the owners of the caches. This file contains 
details on how many caches have each of them hidden and what type of caches 
are they. 

Download the GeoGPXParser.zip file if you just want to use the program and do 
not care about the source code. :) The usage happens from the command line and 
the simple instructions for that are inside the download package as README.txt.
